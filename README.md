# Overview
The objective of TabFairy is to extend the Mozilla Firefox web browser with features that would allow users to keep tabs organized while surfing the internet. 
For many users, organizational challenges occur when they try to open too many tabs. The tab bar quickly becomes cluttered, and since there is only so much space 
in the tab bar, the tab titles become smaller and unreadable. Finding a needed tab becomes a challenging process. It becomes nearly impossible to achieve a productive 
workflow, especially if working on several projects that require working with many tabs.One method to keep the tabs organized is to designate separate Firefox windows 
for different projects. The user might keep several windows running for the duration of the projects. While this solution is better than using just a single Firefox 
window, it adds the additional organizational challenge of switching between windows. It becomes even more difficult to transition between windows if multiple other 
programs are running simultaneously.
